# container_template

## .env file in container

### Active Parameters
The active parameters define paths and proxy settings that the application can use:

#### INPUT="./in": Sets the INPUT environment variable to specify the directory path (relative to the current working directory) where input files are located.

#### OUTPUT="./out": Sets the OUTPUT environment variable to specify the directory path (relative to the current working directory) where output files should be saved.

#### WEIGHTS="./weights": Sets the WEIGHTS environment variable to specify the directory path (relative to the current working directory) where model weights or similar data files are stored.

#### CFG="./cfg": Sets the CFG environment variable to specify the directory path (relative to the current working directory) for configuration files.

#### HTTP_PROXY="$http_proxy": Sets the HTTP_PROXY environment variable to the value of the http_proxy environment variable that is already set in the system. This is used to configure the application to use an HTTP proxy for internet connections.

#### HTTPS_PROXY="$https_proxy": Similarly, sets the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable to the value of the https_proxy environment variable. This is used for HTTPS connections through a proxy.

## Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile, Docker can automate the process of building an image. It's used to create a Docker container image that can then be run as a container. The Dockerfile specifies the environment inside the container, including the code or application, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and other configuration files that the application requires. This allows for consistent and repeatable builds, making it easier to deploy and scale applications across different environments.
1. ARG REGISTRY: This line declares a build-time variable REGISTRY that allows users to specify a Docker registry mirror from which to pull base images. This can be useful for speeding up builds or working around network issues.
2. Use NVIDIA CUDA as base image: FROM ${REGISTRY}/ultralytics/ultralytics:latest: This line sets the base image for the Docker build. It uses the REGISTRY variable to pull the ultralytics image from the specified registry. The tag latest refers to the latest version of this image. This base image is presumably tailored for Ultralytics projects, potentially with NVIDIA CUDA support for GPU-accelerated processing.
3. Define arguments for user and proxy settings: ARG USER_ID, ARG USER_NAME, ARG GROUP_ID, ARG GROUP_NAME, ARG HTTP_PROXY, ARG HTTPS_PROXY: These lines declare build-time variables for user ID, user name, group ID, group name, and proxy settings. These arguments can be passed to the Docker build command and are used to customize the Docker image at build time, particularly for setting up a user inside the container and configuring network proxies.
4. Set environment variables for proxy settings: ENV HTTP_PROXY $HTTP_PROXY, ENV HTTPS_PROXY $HTTPS_PROXY, ENV http_proxy $HTTP_PROXY, ENV https_proxy $HTTPS_PROXY: These lines set both uppercase and lowercase environment variables for HTTP and HTTPS proxies inside the container. This ensures that applications and command-line tools that rely on these environment variables can access the internet via the specified proxies.
5. Install additional packages: RUN pip install lap: Executes the command to install the lap package (Linear Assignment Problem solver) using pip, Python's package installer. This command is run during the build process, adding the package to the Docker image.
6. Create a user and group, remove default workspace: The RUN groupadd -g "${GROUP_ID}" "${GROUP_NAME}" and useradd -m -u "${USER_ID}" "${USER_NAME}" -G "${GROUP_NAME}" commands are used to create a new group and user inside the container with the specified IDs and names. This is important for running the container with files owned by the same user ID as the host system, avoiding permission issues. rm -r /workspace: Removes the /workspace directory, potentially for cleanup or to prepare for a custom setup.
7. Prepare configuration and weights directories: RUN mkdir /cfg /weights creates directories for configuration files and model weights. chown -R $USER_ID:$GROUP_ID /cfg /weights: Changes the ownership of these directories to the newly created user and group, ensuring that the application has the necessary permissions to access these directories.
8. Set user context for running the container: USER "${USER_NAME}:${GROUP_ID}": Sets the user (and group) under which the container will run. This is important for security and for managing permissions on mounted volumes or files created by the container.
9. Copy configuration files: COPY cfg/* /cfg/: Copies configuration files from the host's cfg directory to the container's /cfg directory.
10. Download model weights: RUN curl -L -o /weights/yolov8x.pt https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8x.pt: Uses curl to download the YOLOv8x model weights from Ultralytics' GitHub releases and saves them to the /weights directory. This is an example of preparing the container with necessary model weights for running machine learning models.
11. Set working directory: WORKDIR /workspace: Sets the /workspace directory as the working directory for the container. Any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow will be executed in this context.
12. Local execution (commented out): The commented lines regarding entrypoint.sh suggest an optional configuration for local execution, where an entry script is copied into the container and set as the entry point. This script would be executed when the container starts, allowing for custom startup behavior. This part is commented out, indicating it's an optional step that can be enabled as needed.
13. Example Usage in Dockerfile: ARG USER_ID: This argument could be used to specify the user ID that should be used when creating a user within the container. This is useful for aligning file permissions between the container and the host system. Using ARG in a Dockerfile provides flexibility and customization options during the build process, allowing for more dynamic and configurable Docker images.

## entrypoint.sh
The entrypoint.sh script you've provided is a Bash script designed to be used as the entry point for a Docker container. It dynamically determines how to start the container's main process based on the presence of command-line arguments. Here's an explanation of each component of the script:
1. Shebang: #!/bin/bash: This is the shebang line. It tells the operating system to use Bash to interpret the script. It's necessary because it ensures that the script is executed in a Bash environment, regardless of the invoking shell.
2. Shellcheck Directive: shellcheck disable=SC2086: This is a directive for shellcheck, a tool that analyzes shell scripts and warns about potential issues. SC2086 is a specific warning code that advises against word splitting and globbing issues. By disabling this warning, the script author indicates that they are aware of and accept the potential risks associated with unquoted variables (like $@).
3. Conditional Execution
  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then: This line checks if the number of positional parameters ($#) is equal to 0. Positional parameters are the arguments passed to the script. If this condition is true (meaning no arguments were passed to the script), the script executes the command within the if block.

  yolo cfg=/cfg/detect.yaml: This command is executed if no arguments are passed to the script. It appears to run a program (presumably yolo for object detection tasks) with a specified configuration file (/cfg/detect.yaml). This command is a placeholder for whatever the actual yolo command might be, indicating that the script defaults to a particular configuration when no additional parameters are provided.
else: The else block is executed if the if condition is false, meaning that there are command-line arguments passed to the script.

  yolo $@: In this context, $@ expands to all the positional parameters passed to the script, quoted individually. It allows the script to forward all arguments to the yolo command. This line means that if any arguments are passed to the script, it will call the yolo command with those arguments, allowing the user to override the default behavior (e.g., specifying a different configuration file or additional options).
